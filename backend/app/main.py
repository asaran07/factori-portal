# app.include basically registeres all the indivitual routes like @app.get
# or @app.post from the routers directory with the main `app` instance.
#
# the 'tags=["items"] part is for FastAPI's automatic documentation.
# it basically groups all the routes from items.router under a heading
# called "items" in the documentation. so we'd have different tags for
# different sections/relations for organization.
