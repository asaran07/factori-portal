INSERT INTO material_attributes
VALUES -- we probably wanna have some way to insert-
-- attributes without having to remember what item_id it is.
(1, 'Length', '20cm', 20),
(1, 'Width', '10cm', 10);  -- maybe a way to make sure the num value-
-- matches with the attribute value? not sure.
-- also maybe more than one item can use the same-
-- length/width, what do we do then? we'd have a lot of duplicates.
